# To Do Application Eleven
For their job application procedure I had to build a "to do app" with Java as backend language.

##Requirements
To run this app you need:
* Java development kit
* MySQL server
* Node.js

##
##How to run it
##Spring Boot Application
*Open/import the main folder of the app (i.e ToDoApp-Eleven)
*Go to terminal and change current directory to the "backend" folder (i.e. C:\Users\cindy\Documents\Projects\ToDoApp-Eleven>cd C:\Users\cindy\Documents\Projects\ToDoApp-Eleven\backend)
*This is a maven project, so type the following command
`mvn spring-boot:run`
